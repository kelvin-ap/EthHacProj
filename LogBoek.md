# Logboek Ethical hacking Python

Starting of with exploring the libraries that were given to us as an interesting starting point, aswell as exploring the given demo scripts to see how certain libraries work.

Furthermore I started to develop a website with python as base language, at first i tried doing this with streamlit but after a couple of problems I switched over to using flask library and just a template html. In this website i'm basically trying to give the user a gui or a frontend for easy usage, what actually happens is all done behind the screens.

For example, the user wants to find the ip address, location and other information about a certain website, then he can do so by simply entering the website like 'google.com' in the input field and press the button next to it. The results will be displayed both in rich in the terminal aswell as in the webpage.

### Scripts and libraries

Changed Demo script 1 and 2 to a more OOP style so i could easily intergrate them in my project.

Added DNS Sec validation script and a WhoIs script for domain lookup details. Currently some details in WhoIs lookup still inaccurate however.
